# Introduction 
CSCE 590 Final Project - Spring 2024

In partnership with professors @ Capgemini, we built a Programming Certificate organizer.

Our project allows users to upload their certificates, track their status, and keep an eye on soon-to-expire certs.
It also allows system administrators to view all co-worker certificates, and confirm that their professionals are up to date.
